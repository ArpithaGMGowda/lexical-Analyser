# lexical-Analyser

Lexical Analyzer read the source program character by character and returns the tokens
of the source program. A token describes a pattern of characters having same meaning in
the source program. (Such as identifiers, operators, keywords, number, and so on) The
purpose of the lexical analyzer is to partition the input text, delivering a sequence of
comments and basic symbols are character sequences that correspond to terminal
symbols of the grammar defining the phrase structure of the input. Lexical analysis is the
name given to the part of the compiler that divides the input sequence of characters into
meaningful token strings, and translates each token string to its encoded for, the
corresponding token. Tokens are fairly simple in structure, allowing the recognition
process to be done by a simple algorithm.
